I'll plan the models, migrations, repo/service interfaces, and endpoints for:
Credit (account/invoice-level)
Refund (full/partial, payment reversal)
PaymentMethod (card, bank, etc)
Subscription (full lifecycle: trial, grace, dunning, cancellation, upgrades/downgrades, scheduled plan changes, proration)
Webhook (payment provider events)
InvoiceAdjustment (line-item discounts/credits)
Proration, refund, and advanced billing logic in service/repo layers
Step-by-step plan (pseudocode/data flow, explicit, real-world):
1. Credit
Model: Credit (id, account_id, invoice_id, amount, currency, type, status, created_at, updated_at, metadata)
Migration: credits table, FK to account/invoice
Repo: CRUD, list by account/invoice/status
Service: Apply, consume, expire, list, get
API: POST/GET /credits, GET /credits/:id, PATCH /credits/:id (consume/expire)
2. Refund
Model: Refund (id, payment_id, invoice_id, amount, currency, status, reason, created_at, updated_at, metadata)
Migration: refunds table, FK to payment/invoice
Repo: CRUD, list by payment/invoice/status
Service: Create, process, list, get
API: POST /refunds, GET /refunds, GET /refunds/:id
3. PaymentMethod
Model: PaymentMethod (id, account_id, type, provider, last4, exp_month, exp_year, is_default, status, created_at, updated_at, metadata)
Migration: payment_methods table, FK to account
Repo: CRUD, list by account/status
Service: Add, update, remove, set default, list, get
API: POST/GET /payment-methods, GET /payment-methods/:id, PATCH/DELETE /payment-methods/:id
4. Subscription
Model: Subscription (id, account_id, plan_id, status, trial_start, trial_end, current_period_start, current_period_end, cancel_at, canceled_at, grace_period_end, dunning_until, scheduled_plan_id, scheduled_change_at, created_at, updated_at, metadata)
Migration: subscriptions table, FK to account/plan
Repo: CRUD, list by account/status
Service: Create, update, cancel, schedule change, process dunning, process proration, list, get
API: POST/GET /subscriptions, GET /subscriptions/:id, PATCH/DELETE /subscriptions/:id, POST /subscriptions/:id/change-plan, POST /subscriptions/:id/cancel, POST /subscriptions/:id/resume
5. Webhook
Model: WebhookEvent (id, provider, event_type, payload, status, received_at, processed_at, error, metadata)
Migration: webhook_events table
Repo: CRUD, list by provider/status
Service: Receive, process, retry, list, get
API: POST /webhooks/:provider, GET /webhook-events, GET /webhook-events/:id
6. InvoiceAdjustment
Model: InvoiceAdjustment (id, invoice_id, type, amount, currency, reason, created_at, updated_at, metadata)
Migration: invoice_adjustments table, FK to invoice
Repo: CRUD, list by invoice/type
Service: Apply, list, get
API: POST/GET /invoice-adjustments, GET /invoice-adjustments/:id
7. Proration, Refund, Advanced Billing Logic
Service: Prorate on plan change, handle trial/grace/dunning, process refunds, apply credits/adjustments, preview next invoice, schedule plan changes, update audit log for all billing events
8. Audit Trail for Billing Events
Extend AuditLog: Add billing event types (discount applied, refund issued, credit applied, etc), log all advanced billing actions
All code will be:
Modular, prod-grade, linter-clean, type-safe, secure, and ready for SaaS deployment
No placeholders, no dummy code, no commented-out code
All error handling robust and user-friendly
All migrations, models, repo, service, and API handler code included


Subscription Upgrades/Downgrades
Scheduled plan changes are handled, but:
No explicit endpoint for "upgrade now" vs. "schedule upgrade."
No audit log for plan change events (should log who/when/what for compliance).
No notification logic for users on plan change (email, webhook, etc.).
2. Discounts/Coupons
Discounts: CRUD and application logic exist, but:
No coupon redemption logic (i.e., user redeems a coupon, which applies a discount).
No tracking of coupon usage/redemption per user/account.
No support for stacking multiple discounts/coupons or prioritization rules.
3. Payments
Payment method management: Not visible in the handler/service layer (add/update/remove/set default).
Payment provider integration: No webhook handler for Stripe/PayPal/etc. (for payment status updates, chargebacks, etc.).
Refunds: Not visible in the API/service layer (initiate, process, status).
4. Invoices
Invoice adjustments: Model and repo exist, but not exposed in service/API.
Invoice preview: Present in subscription service, but not exposed via API.
5. Credits/Refunds
Credit application: Model and repo exist, but not visible in API/service.
Refunds: Model and repo exist, but not visible in API/service.
6. Usage/Overages
Overage billing: No explicit logic for usage-based overages (e.g., extra charges if user exceeds plan limits).
Usage aggregation: UsageEvent model exists, but no aggregation logic for billing cycles.
7. Webhooks
Webhook event model: Exists, but no handler for receiving/processing payment provider webhooks.
8. Security/Compliance
No rate limiting, auth, or RBAC on API endpoints (middleware is referenced, but not shown in all routes).
No explicit PCI compliance logic for payment methods (tokenization, secure storage, etc.).
