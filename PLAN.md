# Universal Admin Backend as a Service: Production-Ready Checklist

## API & Integration
- [ ] All features accessible via REST/gRPC APIs (OpenAPI/Swagger documented)
- [ ] Multi-tenant API design (tenant isolation enforced at every layer)
- [ ] Pluggable authentication (JWT, SSO/OIDC, API keys)
- [ ] Webhooks/event bus for admin events (configurable per tenant)
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation policy
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse detection (per-tenant, per-admin, global)

## Security & Compliance
- [ ] Secure by default (no hardcoded secrets, all sensitive data encrypted at rest/in transit)
- [ ] MFA enforcement (per-tenant and per-admin policies)
- [ ] Tamper-evident, immutable audit logs (exportable, SIEM/webhook integration)
- [ ] Secrets management (KMS/Vault integration, key rotation, no plaintext storage)
- [ ] Session management (revoke, expire, device tracking)
- [ ] Permissioned endpoints (RBAC/ABAC, org/project/user scopes)
- [ ] Impersonation with full audit trail

## User, Org, Project, and Resource Management
- [ ] CRUD for users, orgs/tenants, projects, and teams
- [ ] Bulk import/export (CSV, JSON, API)
- [ ] Soft-delete and recovery for critical entities
- [ ] Delegated admin (scoped, cross-tenant, with audit)
- [ ] Custom attributes and metadata per entity

## RBAC & Permissions
- [ ] Custom roles and permissions (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Role/permission assignment at user/org/project/team level
- [ ] Effective permissions API (who can do what, where)
- [ ] Policy engine for advanced access control (optional ABAC)

## API Key & Credential Management
- [ ] Create, rotate, revoke, and list API keys
- [ ] API key usage analytics (last used, usage count, IPs)
- [ ] API key expiration and rotation policy enforcement

## Billing & Monetization
- [ ] Usage-based billing (metered by admins, orgs, API calls, features)
- [ ] Billing hooks (Stripe/Chargebee integration, invoices, plans, quotas)
- [ ] White-label/branding support (custom domain, email templates per tenant)

## Feature Flags & Config
- [ ] Feature flag system (per-tenant, per-user, per-env)
- [ ] Config versioning and rollback
- [ ] Targeted feature rollout (by org, user, or environment)

## Notifications & Alerts
- [ ] System notifications (email, webhook, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] Configurable alerting rules (cost spikes, security events, etc.)
- [ ] Notification delivery status and logs

## Operational Excellence
- [ ] Health checks, metrics, and tracing (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry ready)
- [ ] Zero-downtime deploys (DB migrations, feature flag rollouts)
- [ ] Self-service onboarding (API/CLI for setup, tenant provisioning, admin creation)
- [ ] Cloud-native: containerization, orchestration, and scaling
- [ ] CI/CD ready: linter-clean, type-safe, static analysis, testable

## Extensibility & Uniqueness
- [ ] Modular, clean codebase (no prod/non-prod mixing, no placeholders)
- [ ] Easy to add new resources, endpoints, or integrations
- [ ] Automated insights (cost, security, compliance recommendations)
- [ ] Instant integrations (prebuilt connectors for Stripe, Okta, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] AI/ML hooks (optional anomaly detection, smart alerts, auto-remediation)
