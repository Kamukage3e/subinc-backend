This directory contains modular, production-grade enterprise features for the Subinc Cost Management Microservice. All code here must be SaaS-ready, secure, and reviewed for real-world enterprise deployment.

- No placeholders, no dummy code, no non-prod content.
- All features must be modular and separated from core business logic.
- Use for superuser/admin operations, advanced compliance, integrations, and enterprise-only modules.
